# Purrsuit: A Whisper, A Whisker ‚öîÔ∏èüòº

A C++ game project built with SDL2 and modern CMake.

You can download the distribution via [Purrsuit_dist](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JwROOJ-mXMtT8RjtUZRkc9PJSjtFNx76) (no setup needed).
## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Windows OS (MinGW build system)
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- MinGW with GCC/G++ compiler
- C++17 compatible compiler

### Dependencies
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_mixer
- SDL2_ttf

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

#### Option A: Using vcpkg (Recommended)
```bash
# Install vcpkg
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# Install SDL2 libraries
.\vcpkg install sdl2 sdl2-image sdl2-mixer sdl2-ttf
```

#### Option B: Manual Installation
Download and install the following libraries:
- [SDL2 Development Libraries](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
- [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
- [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
- [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)

### 2. Install MinGW
Download and install MinGW or use MSYS2:
```bash
# Using MSYS2
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
```

### 3. Install CMake
Download from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) or use package manager.

## Building

### Quick Build (Windows)
Simply run the provided batch script:
```cmd
build.bat
```

This script will:
1. Create a `build` directory
2. Configure the project with CMake
3. Build using MinGW Make
4. Run the executable

### Manual Build
```cmd
# Create and enter build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"

# Build the project
mingw32-make

# Go back to root directory
cd ..

# Run the game
Purrsuit.exe
```

### CMake Configuration Options
If using vcpkg, you may need to specify the toolchain file:
```cmd
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path-to-vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

## Running the Game

After successful build, the executable `Purrsuit.exe` will be created in the root directory. Simply run:
```cmd
Purrsuit.exe
```

## Development

### Architecture
The project follows a layered architecture pattern:
- **App Layer**: Application logic, loaders, state management, UI
- **Core Layer**: Game engine, assets management, game states
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, entities, services
- **Repository Layer**: Data access and persistence
- **UI Layer**: User interface rendering and presentation

### Key Features
- Game state management (cutscenes, levels, special states)
- Character and item entities
- Map system
- Save game functionality
- Asset loading and texture management
- Audio support via SDL2_mixer

### Adding New Features
1. Place source files in appropriate `src/` subdirectories
2. Headers are automatically included via CMake configuration
3. The build system uses `GLOB_RECURSE` to automatically include new `.cpp` files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

#### CMake not found
Make sure CMake is installed and added to your system PATH.

#### SDL2 libraries not found
- Verify SDL2 libraries are properly installed
- If using vcpkg, ensure the toolchain file is specified
- Check that all required SDL2 components are available

#### MinGW compiler not found
- Install MinGW or MSYS2
- Add MinGW bin directory to your system PATH
- Verify `gcc` and `g++` are accessible from command line

#### Build fails with linking errors
- Ensure all SDL2 development libraries are installed
- Check that library versions are compatible
- Verify CMake found all required dependencies (check the status messages)

### Debug Build
For debug builds with additional information:
```cmd
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
